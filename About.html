            <h1 class="text-center">About the ISSRF </h1>
            <p class="mx-md-5">The comprehensive approach to reproductive health demands increased awareness on methods
                of
                family planning, maternal health, neonatal morbidity and a growing burden of reproductive ill health
                resulting from reproductive tract cancers, concerns of reproductive organs, sexually transmitted
                infections, including HIV/AIDS, infertility and the adverse effect on gender-based violence. In order
                to provide a common Scientific Platform for all these specialties and for the common cause of
                promoting Reproductive Health Research, The Indian Society for the Study of Reproduction and
                Fertility (ISSRF) was formed and registered in 1988. Over the years, the mandate of the Society has
                broadened and includes various multidisciplinary components of reproductive health.
            </p>
            <h4 style="">Objectives</h4>
            <ol class="mx-md-5">
                <li>To provide a forum for the discussion of Scientific, Clinical, Social and Veterinary knowledge
                    on all aspects of Human and Animal Reproduction.
                </li>
                <li>To facilitate exchange of knowledge and ideas in the area of reproduction through Seminars,
                    Workshops, Conferences and Meetings held from time to time.
                </li>
                <li>To promote the growth of the discipline of Reproductive Biology and Reproductive Medical
                    Care.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Activities</h4>
            <p class="mx-md-5">One of the most regular activities of the Society has been its annual meetings wherein
                the scientists
                belonging to the broad area of reproductive health gather to discuss newer developments in the area.
                To date more than fifty-three national and international conferences have been organized and the
                proceedings of most of them have been published. Young scientists are particularly encouraged to
                participate in the meetings by way of financial support, holding special sessions and presenting awards
                for the best presentations. On the recommendations of the General Body/Executive Committee, the
                Society has instituted following awards: (i) Founder President Dr. T. C. Anand Kumar (Gold Medal)
                Memorial Oration, (ii) Founder President Dr. T. C. Anand Kumar Young Scientist Awards, (iii) Prof.
                G. P. Talwar Gold Medal Award, (iv) Prof. G. P. Talwar Young Scientist Awards, (v) Prof. L. S.
                Ramaswami Memorial Oration, (vi) Prof. N. R. Moudgal Memorial Oration, (vii) Prof. N. R.
                Moudgal Young Scientist Awards, (viii) Dr. (Mrs.) Mridula Kamboj Memorial Oration, (ix) Dr.
                (Mrs.) Mridula Kamboj Young Scientist Awards, (x) Prof. S. S. Guraya Memorial Oration, (xi) Prof.
                S. S. Guraya Young Scientist Awards and (xii) Lifetime Achievement Award for outstanding research
                contributions on different aspects of Reproductive Health. These awards are given at the Annual
                meetings of the Society. The other initiative of the Society has been the publication of its biannual
                Newsletter, ISSRF Newsletter (ISSN: 2395-2806), to disseminate information on reproductive health
                and also facilitate inter- personal communication between the members. The Society has published 30
                issues of the newsletter on various priority areas of reproductive health. The ISSRF has also been
                regularly organizing national workshops on reproductive health awareness, particularly for adolescent
                senior school students, as its mid-term activity. The scientific information about the physical,
                psychological and social changes that take place from childhood to adolescence and adulthood has
                become increasingly important in view of adverse effects due to changing environment & lifestyle
                related to occupational requirements. </p>

            <h4>Facilities to Members</h4>
            <p class="mx-md-5">Founder and Life members of the Society will have the right to (i) participate in the
                scientific and
                business meetings of the Society, (ii) seek sponsorship to participate in International meetings related
                to
                Reproductive Health and apply for financial assistance from the Society, (iii) contest any of the
                Executive Committee posts and (iv) receive free of charge circulars, newsletters, notifications etc.

            <h1>About Ravenshaw University </h1>
            <p>Ravenshaw University came into existence on the 15th day of November, 2006. It was an up-gradation of
                Ravenshaw
                College established in 1868, one of the oldest and largest colleges in India which subsequently became
                an autonomous
                college and was accorded CPE status by UGC and ‘A’ grade by NAAC. The College with all its glorious
                academic
                achievement and ceaseless scholastic pursuits had already created a distinct niche for itself in India
                and beyond. The
                history of this great institution is, in a manner of speaking, the history of modern Orissa. It was the
                cradle of ideas fostering
                national unity and nationalism, promoting social mobilization and gearing up the freedom struggle. The
                grand hall of this
                institution was a theatre of history: on 1 April 1936 it was the venue for the declaration of Orissa as
                a separate province;
                thereafter it housed the state’s first legislative assembly up to and even after Independence till it
                was shifted to
                Bhubaneswar, the new capital of the state. </p>
            <p>Founded with the mission to spread the light of learning, and guided by the motto Jnanameva Shakti
                (Knowledge is
                power), Ravenshaw University aims to preserve its position as the “temple of learning”, with a deep
                knowing that the
                phrase exists in the vernacular for a reason. The university envisions itself as the one-stop
                destination for higher education
                for students from diverse social and economic backgrounds, and will help students to steer their
                passions towards making
                the world a better place.</p>
